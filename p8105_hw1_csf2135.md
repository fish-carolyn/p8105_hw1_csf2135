## Problem 1

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

**Write a short description of the dataset using inline R code** The
“Early January hourly weather data” includes hourly weather data for New
York City regional airports (LGA, JFK, EWR) from January 1, 2013-
January 15, 2013. The data frame includes 358 rows and 15 variables. The
mean reported temperature for January 2013 is 39.58 F.

The variables included in this data frame are: origin, year, month, day,
hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip,
pressure, visib, time_hour.

**Make a scatterplot of temp (y) vs time_hour (x); color points using
the humid variable. Describe patterns that are apparent in this plot.**

Looking at the plot of hourly temperature and humidity by date we can
see that average temperature changes cyclically where temperatures rise
and fall every day. Further, we can see that there was a length of time
between Jan12-Jan15 where relative humidity was higher than observed
earlier in January. Finally, there is an overall trend of increasing
average temperatures until temperatures fall dramatically after January
14. The plot suggests that days of high relative humidity may precede
colder temperatures.

## Problem 2

**Create a data frame comprised of:**

- a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
- a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater
  than 0
- a character vector of length 10
- a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

``` r
p2_data <- tibble(
      rand_samp = rnorm(10), 
      logical = rand_samp >0, 
      character = replicate(10, paste(sample(letters, 5, replace = TRUE), collapse = "")), 
      factor = c("Level1", "Level2", "Level3", "Level1", "Level2", "Level3", "Level1", "Level2", "Level3", "Level1")
)

head(p2_data, n=3)
```

    ## # A tibble: 3 × 4
    ##   rand_samp logical character factor
    ##       <dbl> <lgl>   <chr>     <chr> 
    ## 1     0.311 TRUE    qjisz     Level1
    ## 2     0.123 TRUE    cgmtf     Level2
    ## 3     0.262 TRUE    fljcz     Level3

**Try to take the mean of each variable in your dataframe. What works
and what doesn’t?**

Trying to take the mean of all variables in the problem 2 data set
(p2_data):

rand_samp: 0.35

logical: 0.8

character: NA

factor: NA

The numeric and logical variables could be used to calculate a mean. The
character and factor variables could not be used to calculate a mean.

**Write a code chunk that applies the as.numeric function to the
logical, character, and factor variables (please show this chunk but not
the output).**

``` r
# numeric 
mean(as.numeric(pull(p2_data, var = rand_samp)))

# logical 
mean(as.numeric(pull(p2_data, var = logical)))

#character 
mean(as.numeric(pull(p2_data, var = character)))

#factor
mean(as.numeric(pull(p2_data, var = factor)))
```

**What happens, and why? Does this help explain what happens when you
try to take the mean?**

Attempting to coerce the character and factor variables into numeric
format resulted in the replacement of data with ‘NA’ values. This is
because these variables contained non-numeric characters that could not
be coerced into a number format. The logical vector shows the percent of
observation that are “TRUE” (obs.\>0).
